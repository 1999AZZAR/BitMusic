         * Overrides the D8/R8 that AGP 8.10.1 bundles (8.10.9). Gradle's conflict
         * resolution picks the higher version, so this is the whole mechanism.
         *
         * 8.10.x miscompiles `NowPlayingScreen`, which is large enough — 36
         * parameters, ~5,500 dex instructions, registers past v287 — to hit a
         * register-allocation bug in debug-mode dexing. Resolving phis at one of
         * the join points emits `const/16 v29, #int 48` over the register already
         * holding the `MeshPalette` from `rememberArtworkColors`, and the
         * `MeshGradientBackground` call downstream then reads it back as a
         * reference:
         *
         *   [0x116d] copy-reference v16<-v29 type=PositiveByteConstant
         *
         * ART's verifier rejects the whole class for that, so the dev build died
         * with a VerifyError the moment the player composed. The JVM bytecode
         * kotlinc produces is valid — the fault is entirely in the dex lowering,
         * and it is fixed as of 8.11.32. 8.13.x is the newest 8.x line, and also
         * the first to read Kotlin 2.3 @Metadata: 8.10.9 caps out at 2.2.0 and
         * warns "malformed kotlin.Metadata" on every class this project compiles.
         *
         * Only debug dexing is affected — release-mode allocation keeps the
         * palette in place, which is why prod builds were fine and only dev
         * crashed. Removable once AGP itself bundles something past 8.11.32.
